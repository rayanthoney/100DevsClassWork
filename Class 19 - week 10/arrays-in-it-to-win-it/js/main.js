//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movieArr = ['harry potter', 'lord of the rings', 'house of gucci'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const movie1 = movieArr[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const movieLength = movieArr.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastEl = movieLength[movieLength - 1];
